# Interview Scheduler Project

Interview Scheduler is a front end web application. The front end is built with React.

This application allows users to book appointments through different times of the week with interviewers that are available. The web application is reactive and updates synchronously with the database while displaying to the user the updated changes without ever needing to refresh their browser.
